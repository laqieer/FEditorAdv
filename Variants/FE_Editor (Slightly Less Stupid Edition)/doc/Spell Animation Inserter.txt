Again, animation 0 is reserved. You don't get to touch it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Little documentation will be provided; this feature is similar enough to the class animation creator.

Perhaps the biggest changes between the battle animation system and this one are:

- "~" only terminates the animation if the caster is going to miss
- The button on the dialog that actually terminates the animation also writes it to the index specified
- The C commands now are in the format XXYYZZ, with ZZ being the command ID and XXYY being the arguments

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need help with how to size input images, refer to the example animation.

The example animation can be found along with other related documentation in the "Custom Spell Animations" folder.

Note that background images will be stretched to be twice as high when being displayed on the screen.
