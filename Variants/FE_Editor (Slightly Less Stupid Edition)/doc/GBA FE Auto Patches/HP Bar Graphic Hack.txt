This patch keeps HP bars from having leftover garbage frame data in their graphical data when the game draws them. No more ugly random pixels next to your HP!

This patch is only for FE 7; the other games didn't need it.

NOTE: You can see this garbage in a clean ROM, too. IS screwed up. Start a game in ENM and have Elifail attack the first bandit. You should see this garbage data I speak of.
