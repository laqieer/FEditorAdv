It's been so long since this
little rebellion started. Things
are just going to get[A]
harder[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]but still, there is
hope for the people of Elibe.[A]
However, I don't think I will be
the one to bring it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]whether I[A]
like it or not, this has become
my son's battle. He has told me[A]
his dream, all I can do now is
prepare him to fulfill it.[A]
That's all any father could
do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
