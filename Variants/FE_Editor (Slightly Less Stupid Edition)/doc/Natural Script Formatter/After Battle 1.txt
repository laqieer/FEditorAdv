[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x30][0x01][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x16][0x01]We've seized Caelin, yet I feel
like something is missing.[A][OpenFarRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So much violence[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I
never realized how much[A]
destruction this war has
caused[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]I'm sorry, Shon. You're still
too young[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenFarRight]Nonsense! We've liberated
Caelin. I-I can handle this. I'm
your son, right?[A]
[OpenLeft]That is true. You've proven your
skill today Shon. You are no[A]
longer my apprentice, you are my
peer[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sir Shon.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Father, I don't need a title. I
want to fight for a world where[A]
all people are free. I want to
fight for a world where there is[A]
no hunger or war, only peace and
prosperity. I don't need to be a[A]
knight to do that. All I need is
to fight by your side.[A]
[OpenLeft]Shon[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]that is your dream?[A][OpenFarRight]Yes.[A][OpenLeft]A noble one indeed. However
you'll find that it won't be
that easy.[A]
[OpenFarRight]I know the road will be rough,
but I think I can fulfill my
dream.[A]
[OpenLeft]Well, then I am committed to
helping you see it through.[A][OpenFarRight]Really?[A][OpenLeft]But before you can make positive
changes to the world you have to[A]
reverse the negative changes.
Seizing Caelin was a vital first[A]
step towards restoring the world
to it's former glory. Once we[A]
fulfill that goal you can work
on yours.[A]
[OpenFarRight]Alright father. I shall go send
a messenger to Anakin to relay
the news of our success. I'm[A]
going to take Shuuda and Inanna
with me into the castle first.[A]
We've time to rest before they
embark on their journey.[A]
