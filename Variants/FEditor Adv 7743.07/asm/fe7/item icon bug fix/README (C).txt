The file in the "C Version" folder called "program1.cpp.formatted.dmp" is the output of running "Reg Control.bat" in that folder.

It is compliant with the format and associated utility here:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/336940/Hextator%27s%20Doc/Development/Applications/Patching/Assembly%20Patcher/folDIR.html

which can be used to apply the output file as a patch.

Naturally the "program1.cpp" and "program2.cpp" files are the source files, which are based off of the original assembly source file "Item Icon Bugfix.txt".

The source currently generates the hack with a size not compatible with the location it is placed at with respect to the rest of FEditor's assembly hacks.

More information on "Reg Control.bat" can be found here:
