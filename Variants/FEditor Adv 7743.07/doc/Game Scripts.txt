Due to the sheer size of the game scripts altogether, they have been archived in the "7zip" format and included here:

"Game Documentation/Text/FE Game Scripts.7z"

Pre-dumped just for you, so you can save yourself some time.

Of course, if you ever need to dump a hacked ROM's game script...

...there's a feature for that ;D

Fire Emblem.syn is a TextPad 5 compatible syntax file to be used for viewing the script dumps with syntax highlighting.

You're welcome.
