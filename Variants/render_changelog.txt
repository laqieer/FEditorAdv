Changelog for FEditor Adv Render Fix

Fixed OAM Render in Class Animation Manager
 - Corrected handling of tile alignment (Big thanks to BwdYeti for this fix)
   + Adds a tile scaling factor of 8 to fix render of frames
 - Added handling for flipped tiles
 - Added method for handling Load Transformation Data (LTD) OAM (determines rotation/scaling for OBJs)
   + Can handle up to 5 rotated/scaled OBJ simultaneously
 - Added corrected rendering for rotation/scaling OBJs
 - All animations should render near to identical to in-game rendering

Added "Include Frame" option for animation packages
 - Adds a checkbox option to dump animation frames along with animation package
 - Includes Cam's animation script converter to include animation script to frame folder (Thanks again Yeti!)
   + fixes naming convention to match FEditor's naming convention
   + corrects sign issue when framecount exceeds 128
 - "Dump" option works the same as before if checkbox is left unmarked
 - Also has a "Dump All" option to dump entire Animation Array for current game (Thank Yeti for this one too)
 
Added "Convert" button to Text Editor/Viewer to format text scripts for insertion
 - Takes a preformatted txt file and converts it into separate txt files formatted for insertion in Text Editor/Viewer
 - Essentially does what the .bat file in FEditor Adv's root folder does
 - Requires a particular format to the script to work (See the "Natural Script Formatter.txt" in the doc folder)
