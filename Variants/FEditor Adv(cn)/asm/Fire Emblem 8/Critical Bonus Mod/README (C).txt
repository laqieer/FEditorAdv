This hack modifies the critical bonus normally obtained by Swordmasters and certain other classes to be the usual 15% plus the unit's level, such that a level 20 unit would get a 35% bonus instead, etc.

The source currently places the hack at a location not compatible with the rest of FEditor.

The file called "program1.cpp.formatted.dmp" is the output of running "Reg Control.bat".

It is compliant with the format and associated utility here:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/336940/Hextator%27s%20Doc/Development/Applications/Reformatting/Binary%20Reformatters/Assembly%20Patcher/folDIR.html

which can be used to apply the output file as a patch.

Naturally the "program1.cpp" and "program2.cpp" files are the source files.

More information on "Reg Control.bat" can be found here:
