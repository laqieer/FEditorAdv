The folder "Game Doc" contains information obtained through reverse engineering the games this application works with.

Much of the information implemented by the application originated from here and further information which has yet to be implemented resides with in.

You're welcome!

"Where is the folder?"

The folder has unfortunately been moved to accommodate the issue with ridiculously long file paths appearing in my more general documentation collection.

This one in particular:

"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/336940/Hextator%27s%20Doc/folDIR.html"

You might well be browsing it for all I know.

Here is the path to the folder:

"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/336940/Hextator%27s%20Doc/Media/Games/Console/NGBA/Fire%20Emblem/Game%20Doc/folDIR.html"

Do note that the link in the license in the root directory can be used to acquire a 7zip of the entire "Hextator's Doc" folder if necessary.
