[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x2F][0x01]Sir! This isn't good[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]we're
trapped. Enemy magi just came in[A]
from the north! We're completely
surrounded![A]
No[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]this can't be.[A]
There isn't enough time. Our
best chances are to break[A]
through the mages and retreat to
Sacae.[A]
Dammit! That would mean leaving
Shon alone to fend off Etruria.
Okay[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Gordon, we're going to[A]
cut out of this and make our way
to Castle Caelin. Kevin, go take[A]
everyone else and retreat to
Pherae. Anakin should be there[A]
as well. As soon as you can, I'd
like you to send a message to[A]
Kelik, the swordsman I talked
with a few days ago. Request his[A]
help. I'll take the defense of
Caelin.[A]
Sir Siegfried[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]is this for the
best? Should we scatter, Etruria
can eliminate us easily[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[SendToBack]Kevin, please listen to these
orders. I don't know how long I[A]
can last out here in the field,
nor is there enough time to get[A]
everyone into Castle Caelin to
mount a proper defense. Remember[A]
Kevin, what I said before this
battle? We are all family. I[A]
won't allow my family to just
die. We'll survive, you will[A]
see. It just takes a little will
power.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yes, I understand. Sir
Siegfried, may fortune be with[A]
you. We'll return for you, Sir
Siegfried.[A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Anakin, Kelik[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]you are our
only hope. Looks like this is
the end for me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]

Siegfreid leaves[A][ClearFace]
