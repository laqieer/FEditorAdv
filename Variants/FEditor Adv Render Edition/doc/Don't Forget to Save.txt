D:

Did you remember to go to File->Save or press Ctrl+S/Alt->F->S while at the main GUI (the only window you have when the application first starts outside of a possible command line window) to ensure that you saved your ROM?

If you don't, then you can't expect your changes to be kept.

This application loads the ROM into RAM and edits it there and must be told to put the RAM contents into a file. This is to cut down on potential streaming errors and is how most applications function anyway.
