If the JFP patch doesn't work and you know it should, use the IPS patch.

One way to know that it is safe is if you have used an older version of FEditor on your ROM before.
The patch has been moved to an area where other auto patches used to be and will fail JFP validation if the ROM was previously edited by FEditor.
