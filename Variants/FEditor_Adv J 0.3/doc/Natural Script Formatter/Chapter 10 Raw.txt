## Assault Start
#Example starting position setting:
Shon, right
Gordon, far-right
Siegfried, left: Alright, everybody! The plans are set for our assault. The marquees of Caelin is said to guard its walls, and resistance will be fierce. If anyone wishes to leave, do it now!
Shon: I'm staying, father. I won't abandon you and our soldiers! We've all gone too far to just quit!
Gordon: I'll be by your side, sir.
Shon leaves.
Gordon leaves too.
Tamiko, right: There will be injuries. I shall remain to heal those in need.
Tamiko leaves
Shuuda, right: You paid our wages, thus we stay. Right, Inanna?
Inanna, far-right: Of course. I will not abandon my employer, regardless of the situation!
Shuuda leaves

Althares leaves
Noah, right: This is the most fun I've had in a long while. Count me in!
Noah leaves

## After Battle
Shon, far-right
Siegfried, near-left: We've seized Caelin, yet I feel like something is missing.
Shon: [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So much violence[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I never realized how much destruction this war has caused[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
Siegfried: I'm sorry, Shon. You're still too young[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
Shon: Nonsense! We've liberated Caelin. I-I can handle this. I'm your son, right?
Siegfried: That is true. You've proven your skill today Shon. You are no longer my apprentice, you are my peer[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sir Shon.
Shon: Father, I don't need a title. I want to fight for a world where all people are free. I want to fight for a world where there is no hunger or war, only peace and prosperity. I don't need to be a knight to do that. All I need is to fight by your side.
Siegfried: Shon[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]that is your dream?
Shon: Yes.
Siegfried: A noble one indeed. However you'll find that it won't be that easy.
Shon: I know the road will be rough, but I think I can fulfill my dream.
Siegfried: Well, then I am committed to helping you see it through.
Shon: Really?
Siegfried: But before you can make positive changes to the world you have to reverse the negative changes. Seizing Caelin was a vital first step towards restoring the world to it's former glory. Once we fulfill that goal you can work on yours.
Shon: Alright father. I shall go send a messenger to Anakin to relay the news of our success. I'm going to take Shuuda and Inanna with me into the castle first. We've time to rest before they embark on their journey.
Shon leaves
Siegfried leaves

Siegfried: It's been so long since this little rebellion started. Things are just going to get harder[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]but still, there is hope for the people of Elibe. However, I don't think I will be the one to bring it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]whether I like it or not, this has become my son's battle. He has told me his dream, all I can do now is prepare him to fulfill it. That's all any father could do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]

## Battlefield
Howard, far-left
Siegfried, right: The hell!?
Howard: [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Marquees Caelin[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]it appears you have failed[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
Siegfried: What!? Who are you?
Howard: I am called[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Howard, general of Etruria. You must be Lord Siegfried[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
Siegfried: Hmph, one of Etruria's tools, eh? This battle is over, retreat your men.
Howard: [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Such small number conquering so much. His Majesty wishes you to be disposed of. But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you looks exhausted. It is dishonourable to fight a weakened foe[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Please, let us hold off any battles until you are rested[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
Siegfried: General, do you truly believe that this is honourable? Look around at what Etruria has done. Invading and destroying lands, killing innocent people and treating non-Etrurians like trash! Would a true knight advocate this murder?
Howard: [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I do as His will desires[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
Siegfried: Hmph[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Pathetic[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I can't stand you people[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You Etrurians are all murderers!!! You worthless bastard, I'll kill you!

Howard, left
Siegfried, near-right: Argh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]gah! Hah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]hah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]so strong[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
Howard: Lord Siegfried[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]you said there is no need for battle before.
Siegfried: Heh, are you expecting me to just give up? I still have some fight left in me. Who wishes to fight against us? Who wants to die first?

#From north, enemy Mages, Shaman, and a Sage move towards Siegfried
#Music 0x52 What Comes from Darkness
## Trapped
#Siegfried and Gordon appear
Siegfried, near-right
Gordon, left: Sir! This isn't good[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]we're trapped. Enemy magi just came in from the north! We're completely surrounded!
Siegfried: No[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]this can't be.
Gordon: There isn't enough time. Our best chances are to break through the mages and retreat to Sacae.
Siegfried: Dammit! That would mean leaving Shon alone to fend off Etruria. Okay[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Gordon, we're going to cut out of this and make our way to Castle Caelin. Kevin, go take everyone else and retreat to Pherae. Anakin should be there as well. As soon as you can, I'd like you to send a message to Kelik, the swordsman I talked with a few days ago. Request his help. I'll take the defense of Caelin.
#Kevin appears
Kevin, far-right: Sir Siegfried[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]is this for the best? Should we scatter, Etruria can eliminate us easily[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
Siegfried: [SendToBack]Kevin, please listen to these orders. I don't know how long I can last out here in the field, nor is there enough time to get everyone into Castle Caelin to mount a proper defense. Remember Kevin, what I said before this battle? We are all family. I won't allow my family to just die. We'll survive, you will see. It just takes a little will power.
Kevin: [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Yes, I understand. Sir Siegfried, may fortune be with you. We'll return for you, Sir Siegfried.
Kevin leaves
Siegfried: [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Anakin, Kelik[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]you are our only hope. Looks like this is the end for me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
