The folder "Free Space" contains information regarding memory management inside and outside of working with FEditor.

Do note that memory management is key to not only avoiding corruption of data and thus the ruination of a hack, but also for efficiently using memory so that the hack is as small as possible.

The smaller a hack is the better; someone might want to play the hack on a flash cartridge, and how could they if the hack didn't fit on it?

As well, the GBA only supports ROMs of 32 megabytes or less!
