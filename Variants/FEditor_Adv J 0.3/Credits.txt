These are additional credits handed out by me, Hextator.

Obviously I don't need to credit myself anymore. Well, maybe I do; I'm pretty awesome.

But anyway, you all (should) already know I conceived the editor, wrote most of its code
and fixed most of its bugs regardless of whether my contributions to the project were the
cause.

But did you know that the following people gave varying amounts of effort in helping this
project along?

~~~~~

Major thanks to:

Zahlman
	- For organizing ALL the code and saving me the trouble of doing a sloppy job of it
	on my own once I had actually gotten around to it
	- For fixing up the user interface to be even more friendly

Generic thanks to:

Fire Blazer
	- Contributed some research about the game and conducted tests upon request

Nintenlord
	- His especially vague description of a solution for choosing an optimum OAM layout
	for animations became the beastly algorithm we have now
	- One of his apps (I forget which, sorry! I think it was NLZ GBA...) had some open
	code for doing GBA friendly LZ77 compression in C#. Easily ported to Java and
	working great. Glad I didn't have to figure it out for myself. :P
