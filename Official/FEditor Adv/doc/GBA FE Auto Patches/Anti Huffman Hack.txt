These patches allow text whose reference has the uppermost bit set (example: the pointer equals the value of a pointer pointing to the text PLUS 0x80000000) to be loaded as raw, uncompressed text instead of the referenced data being treated as Huffman encoded text and being decoded normally.

The text editor uses this patch to write text edits to the ROM without compressing them. While this uses more space, you have plenty of space to work with (GBA ROMs can be 32 megabytes in size!) and encoding the Huffman data without updating the frequency table could cause issues; actually updating the frequency table would cost massive amounts of time.
